	</br></br>
	I have 5 years of experience in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Typescript, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and React JS. Hence, I have successfully completed several web projects and web applications from scratch. 
	</br></br>
	Yet, I learn continuously and never stop exploring new technologies.
	So, I have also gained knowledge of SQL, Mongo DB, Node JS, Express JS, Vue.js, Next JS, Astro.build, PHP, Python, firebase, and React Native with time.
