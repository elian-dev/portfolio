	</br></br>
	I have 5 years of experience in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, tailwind CSS, Astro.js, Vue.js, React JS, and Next JS. Hence, I have successfully completed several web projects and web applications from scratch. 
	</br></br>
	Yet, I learn continuously and never stop exploring new technologies.
